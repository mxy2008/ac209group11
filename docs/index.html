<p>This is the website for our movie recommendation system.</p>
<p>We develop a recommendation system to predict ratings that users will assign to movies based on past rating history, and subsequently recommend movies to these users.</p>
<p>We work with a subset of Amazon movie and TV reviews spanning from May 1996 to July 2014. This subset consists of 1.698 millions of user reviews</p>
